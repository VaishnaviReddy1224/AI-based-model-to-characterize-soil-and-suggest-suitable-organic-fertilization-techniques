# 🌱 Soil Nutrient Analysis and Fertilizer Recommendation System

## 📌 System Architecture

The following flowchart represents the step-by-step process of our AI-based soil analysis and fertilizer recommendation system.

### 🔹 **Workflow Explanation**

1️.**Sensor Identification**  
   - Identifies the necessary sensors (e.g., NPK sensor, pH sensor) for soil data collection.

2️.**Sensor Integration**  
   - Connects the identified sensors with the system to gather real-time soil data.
   - Captures soil nutrient levels (NPK) and pH values.

3️.**Dataset Collection**  
   - Gathers soil test data from sensors and integrates it with an external crop recommendation dataset.
   - The dataset includes soil parameters and ideal crop recommendations.

4️.**Data Processing (Cleaning & Preprocessing)**  
   - Cleans the collected data, removes noise, and preprocesses it for machine learning models.
   - Standardizes soil test values for accurate AI model training.

5️. **AI Model Training (Machine Learning & Model Development)**  
   - Develops machine learning models (SVM, KNN, Decision Trees, etc.).
   - Trains the AI system to recommend crops and fertilizers based on soil characteristics.

6️.**Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation**  
   - Predicts suitable crops based on soil conditions.
   - Suggests organic fertilizers based on nutrient deficiencies.

7️.**Validation and Testing**  
   - Tests the accuracy of the AI model using validation datasets.
   - Ensures reliable and efficient recommendations.

8️.**User Interface (Farmer-Friendly Tool)**  
   - Develops a simple and accessible Matlab GUI for farmers.
   - Displays soil analysis results and recommendations in an easy-to-understand format.
