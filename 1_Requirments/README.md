# AI-Based Soil Characterization and Organic Fertilization System

# ðŸ“Œ Requirements

## High-Level Requirements (HLR)
These define the overall system objectives and constraints.

**AI-Based Fertilization Recommendation**: The system must suggest suitable organic fertilizers based on soil data and crop requirements.

**Data Integration & Processing**: The platform should integrate multiple datasets, including soil test results and nutrient requirements.

**User-Friendly Application**: Farmers should be able to easily input soil data and receive recommendations via a simple interface.

**Model Interpretability**: The AI model should provide transparent and understandable recommendations.

**Software Requirements**:
- MATLAB GUI for visualization and user interaction.
- AI Models: SVM, KNN, and Decision Tree for soil and crop recommendations.

## Low-Level Requirements (LLR)
These specify the detailed functional and technical aspects of the system.

### ðŸ”¹ Hardware Requirements:
- Arduino Board
- Breadboard
