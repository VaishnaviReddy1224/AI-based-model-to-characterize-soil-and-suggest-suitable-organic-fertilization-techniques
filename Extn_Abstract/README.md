## Extended Abstract PROJ3999 (Major Project)  

### Title:  
**AI-based model to characterize soil and suggest suitable organic fertilization techniques**  

**Project Supervisor:** Dr. Arvind Kumar  
**Cluster Name:** CS1  
**Project Coordinator:** Dr. Ambar Bajpai  

### Mini Project (PROJ2999) Outcome:  
1. **Soil data collection of different types:**  
   Soil data collection involves gathering information on various types of soil to understand their physical and chemical properties.  

2. **Analysing soil nutrient data:**  
   The collected data is used to evaluate the soil's nutrient levels and identify deficiencies. This information helps in understanding the soil's condition and planning appropriate interventions.  

3. **Crop Recommendation using MATLAB:**  
   The soil data is fed into MATLAB's Classification Learner app to train a machine learning model. This model predicts the most suitable crops for the given soil nutrient profile, helping optimize agricultural productivity.

### Extended Project Abstract   

The project aims to create an AI-driven system to evaluate soil properties and recommend appropriate organic fertilization methods tailored for the Agricultural area. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the system will assess various soil parameters, including pH levels, moisture content, nutrient concentrations, and organic matter presence. Data for these parameters will be gathered through an embedded system equipped with sensors, enabling real-time soil monitoring. This embedded system will process the collected sensor data and send it to a central processing unit, where machine learning models will analyze the information to predict soil health and suggest optimal organic fertilization strategies.  

The machine learning aspect of the project involves training models on historical soil and crop yield data to decipher the correlation between soil attributes and effective fertilization practices. These models will be regularly updated with new data to enhance their accuracy and responsiveness to changing environmental conditions.  

The outcome of this project will be a comprehensive, cost-effective solution that enables farmers to improve soil fertility and increase crop yield through informed organic fertilization practices. This approach will ultimately support sustainable agriculture in the region. The integration of real-time data collection with advanced analytical capabilities will provide farmers with actionable insights, promoting the efficient use of organic fertilizers. By leveraging historical data and continuous updates, the AI model will adapt to varying environmental conditions, ensuring that recommendations remain relevant and effective. This innovative solution aims to empower the local farming community, fostering sustainable agricultural practices and contributing to the long-term health of the soil ecosystem.
