# ðŸ“Œ Testing

## 1.Model Performance Evaluation (Using MATLAB Classification Learner App)

**Load the dataset in MATLAB Classification Learner App.**

**-Train multiple machine learning models, including:**

Decision Trees

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

**-Compare model performance using:**
Accuracy
Confusion Matrix
ROC Curve

Select the best-performing model for soil classification and recommendation.

## 2.MATLAB GUI Testing with Various Data
**Develop a MATLAB GUI to input sensor values manually and get AI predictions.**

**Test with different soil parameters:**

Low NPK & High PH â†’ Check if acid-neutralizing fertilizers are recommended.

High NPK & Low PH â†’ Ensure AI suggests irrigation techniques.

Balanced Soil Conditions â†’ Validate normal crop recommendations.

Optimize GUI response time and visual output clarity.
